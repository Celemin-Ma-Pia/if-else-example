# if else simple example
The user will have to input a number. If num1 is 10 or more then it will test another statement to see if num1 is less than or
equal to 20. If it is, it will display the message "This is between 10 to 20". If num1 is not less than or equal to 20 then it
will display the message "This is over 20". If num1 is not over 10, it will display  the message "This is under 10".
